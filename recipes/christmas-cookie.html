        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Soft cut out sugar cookie that I have used for years. I sprinkle with colored sugar before baking or you could also try icing them when cool.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and chill for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a clean floured surface, roll out small portions of chilled dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters.</li>
            <li>Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
        </ol>
